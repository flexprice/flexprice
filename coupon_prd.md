## We have 3 entities for now which is coupon, coupon association and coupon application. I want to make them applicable inside the subscription service and invoice service.

### Entitites to look out for
Coupon association is associating coupon -> subscription
Coupon application is applyin coupon to invoice

### What not to do ?
- There's no concept of coupon code yet
- There's no rule engine yet
