# Flexprice: The Complete Billing Solution for Growing Companies

## Executive Summary

Flexprice is a comprehensive billing solution designed to solve the challenges faced by growing SaaS companies as they scale from simple subscription models to complex usage-based billing. Born from real-world challenges experienced at Aftershoot (which scaled from $1M to $10M ARR in just 1-1.5 years), Flexprice fills a critical gap in the market for mid-market companies that need sophisticated billing capabilities without the enterprise price tag.

## The Problem: Billing Systems Break as Companies Scale

Most companies face predictable breaking points in their billing systems:

1. **Breaking Point 1**: When introducing multiple plans, add-ons, or complex pricing
2. **Breaking Point 2**: When adding usage-based components that require accurate metering
3. **Breaking Point 3**: When implementing enterprise features like custom contracts
