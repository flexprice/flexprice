### 1.2 Scope
- Multi-tenant authorization system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Frontend and backend integration
- Policy management interface
- Audit logging and monitoring

### 1.3 Goals
- Implement fine-grained access control
- Support multi-tenant isolation
- Provide flexible permission management
- Enable attribute-based permissions
- Support role hierarchies
- Maintain performance and scalability

## 2. Current System Analysis

### 2.1 Authentication Architecture
```

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Current Limitations
- **No Authorization Layer**: Only authentication, no permission checking
- **No Role Management**: No role-based access control
- **No Attribute-based Control**: No dynamic permission based on user attributes
- **No Multi-tenant Isolation**: No tenant-aware permission system
- **No Audit Trail**: No logging of access attempts

### 2.3 Data Flow
1. User authenticates via Supabase
2. JWT token contains user ID and tenant ID
3. Backend validates token and extracts user/tenant info
4. **Missing**: Authorization checks for resources and actions
