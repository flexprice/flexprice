# Implementation Summary: Optimized Wallet Balance Calculation

## Overview
We have implemented a high-performance wallet balance calculation system that can handle millions of events while maintaining millisecond-level responsiveness. This implementation addresses the key challenges identified in our analysis of the current system.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Optimized Wallet Balance Calculation
- Added a new `GetWalletBalanceEstimated` method to the wallet service
- Implemented multi-level caching of balance calculations
- Created a usage rate projection system for real-time estimates

### 2. Redis Caching Infrastructure
- Added Redis client interface for better testability
- Implemented cache for wallet balances, usage data, and usage rates
- Used time-based cache invalidation to balance accuracy with performance

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoint
- Added a new `/wallets/{id}/balance/estimated` endpoint
- Added informative response headers for estimated values
- Enhanced DTO with additional fields for better client information

## Performance Improvements
- **Reduced Database Load**: Cached wallet balances reduce the need for repeated expensive calculations
- **Time-Based Projections**: Usage rate projections allow for accurate estimates between full calculations
- **Optimized API**: Separate endpoints for exact vs. estimated balances let clients choose between performance and precision

## Future Enhancements
The following items from our solution plan should be implemented next:

1. **ClickHouse Optimization**:
   - Implement materialized views for common aggregations
   - Add TTL policies for automatic data cleanup
   - Optimize table schema and partitioning

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Enhance bulk event processing for higher throughput
   - Implement Kafka optimization for producer/consumer configs

3. **Background Processing**:
   - Move full balance calculations to background jobs
   - Implement a job queue system for non-blocking operations

## Conclusion
This initial implementation significantly improves the wallet balance calculation performance while maintaining accuracy. The caching system with rate projections allows for millisecond-level response times even with high event volumes.
