# Recurring Credit Grant System - Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the Recurring Credit Grant Application System, designed to automatically process and apply recurring credit grants to customer wallets based on subscription billing cycles.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components

The system consists of several key components that work together to provide a robust, scalable recurring credit grant processing capability:

1. **Scheduled Processing Engine** - Cron jobs for automated processing
2. **Business Logic Layer** - Core services handling grant processing
3. **State Management** - Subscription state handling and transitions
4. **Data Persistence** - Repositories and domain models
5. **Integration Layer** - APIs and webhook events
6. **Observability Stack** - Monitoring, logging, and alerting

### Component Interaction Flow

```
[Cron Scheduler] → [Credit Grant Service] → [State Handler] → [Wallet Service]
       ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓
[Configuration] → [Repository Layer] → [Domain Models] → [Database]
       ↓                      ↓                    ↓              ↓
[Health Checks] → [Event Publisher] → [Audit Logger] → [Monitoring]
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Event-Driven vs. Scheduled Processing

**Decision**: Hybrid approach using both scheduled processing and event-driven state changes.

**Rationale**:

- **Scheduled Processing**: Ensures all recurring grants are processed reliably, even if events are missed
- **Event-Driven**: Provides immediate response to subscription state changes for better user experience

### 2. Idempotency Strategy

**Decision**: Application-level idempotency using unique keys based on grant, subscription, and billing period.

**Implementation**:

```go
idempotencyKey := fmt.Sprintf("recurring_%s_%s_%s_%s",
    grantID, subscriptionID, periodStart, periodEnd)
```

### 3. State Management Approach

**Decision**: Explicit state handler with deterministic action mapping.

**Benefits**:

- Clear business logic separation
- Easy testing and validation
- Consistent behavior across different subscription states

### 4. Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-tier error handling with retry mechanisms.

**Tiers**:

1. **Transient Errors**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Business Errors**: Log and skip, no retry
3. **Fatal Errors**: Alert and manual intervention required

## Data Flow Architecture

### Processing Pipeline

```
Input: Subscription + Credit Grant
       ↓
Validation: Eligibility Check
       ↓
State Analysis: Subscription Status
       ↓
Action Determination: Apply/Defer/Skip/Cancel
       ↓
Wallet Operation: Credit Application
       ↓
Output: Application Record + Audit Log
```

### Data Models Relationship

```
CreditGrant (1) ←→ (N) CreditGrantApplication
     ↓                        ↓
     ↓                        ↓
Subscription (1) ←→ (N) CreditGrantApplication
     ↓                        ↓
     ↓                        ↓
Customer (1) ←→ (N) Wallet ←→ (N) WalletTransaction
```

## Integration Points

### Internal Service Dependencies

1. **Wallet Service**: For credit application to customer wallets
2. **Subscription Service**: For subscription lifecycle management
3. **Billing Service**: For billing period calculations
4. **Event Service**: For publishing application events
5. **Audit Service**: For compliance and tracking

### External Dependencies

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
2. **Cache**: Redis for performance optimization (optional)
3. **Message Queue**: For asynchronous event processing
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for observability
5. **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs

## Scalability Considerations

### Processing Volume

The system is designed to handle:

- **10,000+ active subscriptions** with recurring grants
- **100+ concurrent grant processing** operations
- **1M+ credit applications** per month
- **Sub-second response times** for API operations

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple grants in parallel
2. **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for large datasets
3. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database resource utilization
4. **Caching Strategy**: Reduce redundant database calls
5. **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking processing where possible

## Security Architecture

### Access Control

- **API Endpoints**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- **Admin Operations**: Restricted to authorized personnel only
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all credit applications
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit

### Input Validation

- **Request Validation**: All inputs validated at API boundary
- **Business Rule Validation**: Domain-level validation in services
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of manual trigger endpoints

## Monitoring and Alerting
