# Subscription Billing System PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and considerations for FlexPrice's subscription billing system, focusing on reliable and accurate invoice generation for complex pricing models.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation has several edge cases and potential issues that need to be addressed to ensure accurate billing across various pricing models and scenarios.

## Key Requirements

### Key Requirements for today

##### 1. Billing Period Management
- **Multiple Period Transitions**
  - Generate separate invoices for each billing period
  - Handle delayed cron job scenarios
  - Maintain billing period integrity
  - Track and verify period coverage

- **Period Boundaries**
  - Define clear start/end time handling
  - Consider timezone implications
  - Handle DST transitions
  - Support global customer base

##### 2. Invoice Generation Integrity
- **Duplicate Prevention**
  - Implement idempotency keys
  - Add unique constraints
  - Handle concurrent operations
  - Define recovery procedures

- **Data Consistency**
  - Ensure atomic operations
  - Maintain audit trail
  - Handle partial failures
  - Support reconciliation

### Key Requirements for Future

#### 3. Pricing Model Support
- **Fixed Pricing**
  - Support multiple currencies
  - Handle minimum commitments
  - Implement volume discounts
  - Support trial periods

- **Usage-Based Pricing**
  - Real-time metering
  - Usage aggregation rules
  - Support multiple meters
  - Handle usage resets

- **Tiered Pricing**
  - Support multiple tier types
  - Handle tier transitions
  - Calculate tier thresholds
  - Support graduated pricing

#### 4. Subscription Changes
- **Mid-Period Changes**
  - Handle plan upgrades/downgrades
  - Calculate prorations
  - Support immediate/delayed changes
  - Maintain pricing history

- **Cancellations**
  - Immediate vs end-of-period
  - Handle refunds
  - Calculate final charges
  - Support reactivation

#### 5. Error Handling & Recovery
- **System Failures**
  - Define retry policies
  - Handle partial completions
  - Support manual intervention
  - Maintain system integrity

- **Data Inconsistencies**
  - Detect anomalies
  - Support reconciliation
  - Provide audit tools
  - Enable corrections

## Technical Considerations

#### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add idempotency support
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN idempotency_key VARCHAR(50);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_invoice_idempotency ON invoices (idempotency_key) WHERE status != 'void';

-- Add period tracking
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN billing_sequence INTEGER;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_subscription_period ON invoices (subscription_id, period_start, period_end) WHERE status != 'void';
```

#### Code Changes Required
1. Update `processSubscriptionPeriod`:
   - Generate invoices for each transition
   - Add idempotency checks
   - Improve error handling

2. Enhance `CreateSubscriptionInvoice`:
   - Use `CalculateCost` for all price types
   - Add validation checks
   - Improve logging

3. Add new service methods:
   - `ValidateBillingPeriod`
   - `ReconcileInvoices`
   - `HandleFailedInvoices`

## Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Fixes
- Fix multiple period transition handling
- Implement idempotency
- Update price calculations

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Add comprehensive validation
- Improve error handling
- Enhance monitoring

#### Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities
- Add reconciliation tools
- Implement audit system
- Add admin controls

## Monitoring & Alerts
- Track failed invoice generations
- Monitor period coverage gaps
- Alert on pricing anomalies
- Track system performance

## Future Considerations
- Multi-currency support
- Tax handling
- Custom billing cycles
- Advanced proration rules
